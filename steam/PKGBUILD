# WARNING!!!!!
# If you are going to modify this package (other than just update it) keep in mind that:
# the launcher is steam_launcher.sh that 
# a) prints a warning about Chakra not being officially supported by steam and points to the Chakra wiki for games that don't work. This requires kdialog
# b) add an hack to use Chakra libs than steam owns that give a lot of problems
# https://chakralinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Steam#Missing_Direct_Rendering
#
# The steam.sh launcher needs zenity but we have qarma that is a replacement of it written in Qt
# I don't want to add qarma as direct dependency because a user can chose to install qarma or zenity and it doesn't change anything, rather than installing qarma as hard dep in any case (and this is not KISS)
# Also pacman installs qarma fine
#
# NOTE If you are thinking something like:
# "I don't like this, put everything under optdepends because it's easier to do/I don't like hack, who cares, I don't even use steam"
# keep in mind everytime steam won't work we have a new issue on the forum to take care or an user we lost because she can't play games on Chakra
# Are you going to accept responsibility for that?
# Are you going to help EVERY user that has problem with steam that this hack could prevent?
# And do this for the next years? If the answer's no, then don't touch this PKGBUILD (you can just update it)
